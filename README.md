# ecs417 project

This is my first attempt at creating a portfolio website/blog, done during my first year studying Computer Science. I did not use any frameworks and strictly learned and used html, css, js and php.


Here is a link to a video displaying the working website:

The main aims of this project were to:
  - develop a portfolio page
  - develop a blog page with posts sorted by date
  - develop a user sign up / log in / log out system
  - allow for signed in users to comment
  
 Admittedly, this is also my first time in a while graphic designing (using pixelmator pro) so the website isn't as beautiful as I hoped. My next attempt will hopefully look and perform a lot better, and I plan to implement frameworks like React.js and Three.js
